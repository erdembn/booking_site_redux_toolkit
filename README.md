## Booking Site With Redux Toolkit

This app doesn't use any database. Login functionality is only for demonstration purposes. When you log in, the app automatically assigns the user with a dummy profile. 

### Booking

You can book by visiting the corresponding page by clicking the title. You can submit the date and time with an additional note (not mandatory). You can later change the date or edit the note on your profile. Also, there is a page for the user's properties. Users can edit the price or delete the property. 

Note: Needs refactoring(Especially for pages).
